# My 10K Running Performance

In this project, I am analysing my running performance using GPS records collected during trainings.

## Data

I am using a __Garmin Forerunner 10__ GPS watch to record each run. These records were collected on the [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/fr-FR/) platform. All runs were downloaded and saved in the [Activities.csv](https://github.com/mgirardot/Running/blob/master/Activities.csv) file.

## Results

The details of the analysis performed are explained in [here](https://github.com/mgirardot/Running/parse_fit_data.html).
